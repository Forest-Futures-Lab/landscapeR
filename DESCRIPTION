Description: This set of functions allows the simulation of categorical maps from scratch in a geographically referenced landscape or the manipulation of existing ones. The basic algorithm currently implemented uses a simple agent style/cellular automata growth model, with no rules (apart from areas of exclusion), expanding more or less circularly (cells are picked at the edges randomly).
